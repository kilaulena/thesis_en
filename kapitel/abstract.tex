\chapter*{Abstract}

Modern web browsers and mobile devices are capable of running complex applications that allow collaboration and data exchange between their users. Laptops and mobile phones, however, cannot be expected to keep their internet connections alive at all times. This problem can be sidestepped using data replication, which means that data are regularly synchronised and kept consistent. This thesis describes the drafting and prototypical development of a JavaScript application that uses the document-oriented database CouchDB to form distributed outliner software. Outliners can be used to record thoughts or concepts in a hierarchically structured manner. Apart from categorising the system to be developed and analysing possible approaches, the thesis will also examine the technologies used. Special focus lies on CouchDB with its built-in master-master replication and its ability to implement complex applications without the use of middleware. The final application runs locally in the browser and is therefore also usable when off-line. Conflicts are resolved when the system is synchronised, sometimes steered by user input. The thesis also evaluates the applicability of CouchDB in distributed applications with particular regard to the use case at hand.
