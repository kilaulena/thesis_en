\chapter{Technical fundamentals}
\label{chap:grundlagen}

This chapter will present the individual web technologies that have been used in the application. Next, the fundamentals of cloud computing will be discussed since it played an important role in the deployment of the application. The final section discusses the methods and means that have played a supporting role in the application's development.


\section{Web technologies}
\label{sec:webtechnologien}

The interactive possibilities offered by the user interface of the application to be developed are few. The use of laborious view frameworks is therefore not necessary. The application can be implemented with comparatively simple technologies, frameworks and programming languages, all of which will be presented individually.


\subsection{CouchApp}
\label{subsec:couchapp}

The application to be developed will be implemented as a so-called CouchApp \cite{couch:couchapp}. The CouchApp project makes a set of supporting components available that make the task of developing a standalone application with CouchDB lighter. The design requires every user to install her own offline CouchDB instance on her device in which the application will run. This means that the application is also available when the user is disconnected from the Internet.

In \cite{couchapp:interview} Damien Katz, CouchDB's creator, describes CouchApps as follows:

\begin{quote}
CouchDB, being an HTTP server, can host applications directly, so you can write applications and forward the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through CouchDB. When you point your browser at it, the browser comes alive and starts the JavaScript. It becomes interactive as you query and update the server and everything. When everything is served from CouchDB, that's a CouchApp and you can replicate it around, just like the data. 
\end{quote}

A CouchApp can be deployed onto a local computer, a mobile phone, a local server or even in the cloud. In any case the application is accessed from the browser. Replication allows the updating of both data and the program itself.

After installing CouchApp (as explained in section \ref{subsec:deployment}), the framework for a new sample application may be generated by issuing the command \lstinline!couchapp generate example-couchapp! on the command-line interface. This will create a folder {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont example-couchapp} with a defined directory structure (see Fig. \ref{fig:example-couchapp}). This directory corresponds to a CouchDB design document as described in section \ref{subsec:designdokumente}.

\medskip
\begin{figure}[ht] 
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{grafik/example-couchapp} 
 \end{center}
 \caption{Generated sample CouchApp}
 \label{fig:example-couchapp} 
\end{figure}

The directory {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont \_attachments} contains all JavaScript, HTML and CSS files that are required for the application logic and the presentation. A default HTML start page and style sheet have been automatically generated. The directories {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont lists}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont show}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont views} and {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont filters} contain CouchDB's list, show and filter functions resp. the views. The {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont vendor} directory is home to external libraries that are needed in the development process.

The deployment settings are saved in the file {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont .couchapprc}, which is formatted as follows:

\lstset{language=javascript}
\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:couchapprc,caption=Couchapp: .couchapprc]
{
  "env": { 
    "default": {
      "db": "http://user:password@localhost:5984/example-couchapp-dev"
    },
    "production": {
      "db": "http:///user:password@example.com/example-couchapp"
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}


It is necessary to specify the CouchDB administrator's user name and password for the development and in some cases also the production environment. This information can be omitted if user credentials are not set. The command \lstinline!couchapp push! or \lstinline!couchapp push production! copies the contents of the CouchDB directory into the CouchDB instance.

The URL scheme of a CouchApp will be described in section \ref{subsec:routes}. Section \ref{subsec:deployment} will cover how to deploy the application developed in this thesis with the aid of CouchApp.
 


\subsection{HTML5}
\label{subsec:html5}

\textit{HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)} is the hypertext format commonly used on the world wide web. \textit{HTML5} \cite{html5:homepage} is a specification developed by the W3C that should replace the existing HTML and XHTML standards. HTML5 is currently widely supported in recent versions of the most popular browsers, with one exception for Microsoft Internet Explorer \cite{html5:browser}. This limitation hampers the development of most web applications since they have to be compatible with browsers that are older or not standard-compliant.

Due to limitations described detailedly in section \ref{subsec:nochanges}, the application is tailored to be used with the browser Firefox, version 3.6 or higher (see release notes \cite{firefox36}). This allows the application to use HTML5 functionality, even for its core workings. For example, apart from many improvements, HTML5 also allows defining custom data attributes. This technique is used in this thesis and will therefore briefly be introduced.

According to the specification \cite{html5:data}, a custom data attribute is an attribute without namespace whose name starts with the string {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont data-}, having at least one lowercase character and no uppercase characters after the hyphen. Custom data attributes can store private data for the site or the application when there are no fitting attributes or elements to do so. The attributes are intended to be used by the page's own scripts, not as publicly available meta data. Every HTML element can have any number of custom data attributes.


\subsection{JavaScript}

JavaScript is a versatile scripting language whose affiliation with the web browser makes it \enquote{one of the most popular programming languages in the world} \citelit[p. 2]{javascript:goodparts}. The \textit{DOM (Document Object Model)} \cite{dom:website} allows the browser to directly access JavaScript objects in an HTML document. JavaScript is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that follows a prototype-oriented paradigm.

JavaScript is most widely used to enhance the user experience. Websites are \enquote{enriched} with client-sided functionality, but are also accessible without JavaScript. JavaScript can also be used on the server side as a fully fledged programming language. Unlike Java or C, JavaScript implements object-orientation with prototypes instead of classes.

The next section will discuss the JavaScript component JSON, the AJAX concept as well as the jQuery library.

\subsubsection{JSON}
\label{subsec:json}

\textit{JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)} is the most popular form for exchanging information in JavaScript \citelit[Chap. 2]{json:javascript}. JSON is a subset of JavaScript \cite{json:rfc}, which means that it is valid JavaScript in itself. Not all data types that exist in JavaScript can be used in JSON, only the data types {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Object}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Array}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont String}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Number}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Boolean} and {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Null} are used. Almost all common programming languages, however, have equivalent data types. This makes JSON also suitable for exchanging data with other languages \cite{json:crockford}.

Examples of JSON can be found in listings \ref{lst:mustache} and \ref{lst:shardsconf-long}.

\subsubsection{AJAX}
\label{subsec:ajax}

\textit{AJAX} is an acronym for \textit{Asynchronous JavaScript And XML}. It does not indicate a software package or framework. Jesse James Garrett, who coined the term in 2005 in \cite{ajax:approach}, describes AJAX as

\begin{quote}
[...] an approach â€” a way of thinking about the architecture of web applications using certain technologies.
\end{quote}

According to \cite{ajax:approach}, AJAX comprises several technologies from the realms of web development: the representation with XHTML and CSS, dynamic interaction through the DOM, data exchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT (or another data exchange format such as JSON), asynchronous data requests with XMLHttpRequest, and finally JavaScript to link all these components together. This set-up allows the asynchronous transfer of data between browser and server.

A web application is usually built in such a way that an action in the user interface provokes an HTTP-request from the web server. The server calculates the result with the aid of application logic and/or database requests and returns an HTML page to the client (cf. \cite{ajax:approach} and figure \ref{fig:classic-interaction-pattern}).

\medskip
\begin{figure}[ht] 
 \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{grafik/ajax-classic} 
 \end{center}
 \caption[Synchronous interaction flow chart of a traditional web application]{Synchronous interaction flow chart of a traditional web application, from \citelit{ajax:book}}
 \label{fig:classic-interaction-pattern} 
\end{figure}

The use of the technologies mentioned above allows the browser to load data from the server asynchronously and in the background, without changing the display and the behaviour of the page that is open in the browser. If the server sends an answer only those parts of the site are changed for which new data is available - there is no need to reload the page (figure \ref{fig:ajax-interaction-pattern}). The advantage here is that the page does not have to be rendered again with every request which also means less data have to be transferred.

 \label{fig:ajax-interaction-pattern} 
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{jQuery}

A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-defined JavaScript functions that simplify the development of web applications. The application's user interface is developed with the aid of the JavaScript library jQuery version 1.4 \cite{jquery:homepage}:

\begin{quote}
jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. \cite{jquery:homepage}
\end{quote}

JQuery is an abstraction of basic JavaScript functionality. In particular, it simplifies DOM traversing. At the same time it doesn't impose a structure for the application.

In a non-representative poll conducted in April 2010 by the organisation \textit{Web Directions} among professional web developers and designers, some 78\% of the inquired indicated that they used jQuery when writing JavaScript code. \cite{jquery:verbreitung}


\subsection{Sammy.js}
\label{subsec:sammy}

\textit{Sammy.js} \cite{sammy:homepage} is a routing framework that builds on jQuery. Sammy allows developers to define \textit{routes} to which a certain behaviour can be associated. The controller part of applications can thus be implemented event-based and RESTful. The use of Sammy in the application is described in section \ref{subsec:routes}.

\subsubsection{Routes}

A Sammy route consists of the following elements:

\begin{description}
  \item[A path:] The anchor part in a URL, thus the part after the URL hash ({\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont\#}). It can be defined as a string or a regular expression in the specification of the route.
  \item[A method:] One of the HTML methods {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont GET}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont POST}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont PUT} or {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont DELETE}.
  \item[A callback:] A function that is called when the route is executed with a certain method.
\end{description}

Even when the path is the same, different callbacks can be set according to the method used. For example, the resource outline may be shown using the route \enquote{\lstinline!get('#/outlines/:id')!} and updated using \enquote{\lstinline!put('#/outlines/:id')!}. Thanks to the usage of the URL anchor, client-side applications may run on one page and still react to the browser's \enquote{Back} button.

It is Sammy's task to parse parameters from the path. In this way, IDs or slugs can be filtered from the path. Every string within the path that starts with a colon \enquote{:} will be turned into a parameter.

Routes with the methods {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont POST}, {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont PUT} and {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont DELETE} are only executed by submitted HTML forms. In run-time, the {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont submit} method is overwritten for all forms and hooked to Sammy. When the form is submitted, a route is sought that corresponds to the form's path and the method. If such a route is found its callback function is executed.

Routes can also be hooked onto user-defined events that are then executed by the application. For example, when the Sammy application is loaded for the first time, an {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont init} function can be called that assigns certain behaviour to the elements on the site.


\subsubsection{Sammy plug-ins}

Sammy offers the option to define custom plug-ins. A plug-in is some program code that is included just like the rest of the library but that is only used when it is first requested.

The following example, taken from \cite{sammy:plugins}, defines the helper function {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont alert()}, that overwrites the JavaScript function {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont alert} and replaces it by an entry from the log file:

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Sammy.js: example of a plug-in]
var MyPlugin = function(app) {
  this.helpers({
    alert: function(message) {
      this.log("ALERT! " + message);
    }
  });
};
\end{lstlisting}

A plug-in is called using the {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont use()} method. This way, the plug-in function is utilised in the context of the current Sammy application. If the example plug-in is loaded the method can be used in all routes.

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Sammy.js: including a plug-in]
var app = $.sammy(function() {
  this.use(MyPlugin);
  this.get('#/', function() {
    this.alert("I'm home"); //=> logs: ALERT! I'm home
  });
});
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Mustache.js}
\label{subsec:mustache}

The rendering of HTML sites is done by the template engine \textit{Mustache} \cite{mustache:homepage}. A template engine is software that fills certain placeholders in a file with contents that are passed on to it. Mustache is implemented in several programming languages, here the JavaScript version \textit{Mustache.js} is used.

Using Mustache it is possible to separate code and markup \cite{mustache:couchio}. The markup is done in an HTML file that contains placeholders for non-static values. The program code that calculates the resulting values or declares the variables is placed into a view. A view is a JSON object with attributes and methods that correspond to the placeholders in the template.

The following snippet exemplifies this (from \cite{mustache:other}):

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Mustache.js: Example of a template]
Hello {{name}},
you have just won {{gross_value}}$!
{{#taxable}}
Well, {{net_value}}$, after taxes.
{{/taxable}}
\end{lstlisting}


\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Mustache.js: View passed on, label=lst:mustache]
{
  "name": "Chris",
  "gross_value": 10000,
  "net_value": 10000 - (10000 * 0.4),
  "taxable": true
}
\end{lstlisting}

The Mustache library is a JavaScript file that is loaded in run-time. After calling the method {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Mustache.to\_html(template, view)} the template and view are rendered:

\medskip
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Mustache.js: result]
Hello Chris,
you have just won 10000$!
Well, 6000.0$, after taxes.
\end{lstlisting}

Since there is no code inside the templates that needs to be parsed, Mustache makes programming according to the \textit{MVC} \textit{(Model View Controller} architecture possible \cite{mustache:couchio}. In an up-to-date comparison with seven other JavaScript templating libraries carried out by Brian Landau, Mustache.js did very well \cite{mustache:bench}.


\subsection{Further libraries}

The interface is constructed using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The layout is done using the CSS framework \textit{Blueprint} \cite{blueprint:website}. Blueprint produces a container with a certain width in pixels, within which a grid-based layout can be structured. This grid is subdivided into 24 columns. The distribution of the elements on the page is done by assigning a certain {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont class} to them. A {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont div} element with the instruction \lstinline!<div class="column span-16">! will automatically fill two thirds of the container. Blueprint also guarantees cross-browser compatibility; a site developed with Blueprint will show identical behaviour, irrespective of the browser type. Moreover, Blueprint contains several style sheets containing pre-defined designs that can be used in a new project.

The jQuery plug-in \textit{jquery.autogrow} \cite{jquery:autogrow} allows text areas that contain the outliner's lines to automatically adapt to the amount of text they contain. As text is being typed the textarea grows along in width and if necessary in height. This is achieved by calling the corresponding function on the DOM element: \lstinline!$('textarea').autogrow();! 

Further jQuery plug-ins being used are \textit{jquery.md5}, \textit{jquery.unwrap}, \textit{jquery.scrollTo}, \textit{jquery.color} and \textit{date.format}.


\section{Cloud computing}
\label{sec:cloud}

The deployment of the application was done using so-called \textit{Cloud Computing}. The term in itself is a metaphor for Internet services, since they are often represented in computer network diagrams as clouds (see figure \ref{fig:cloud-computing}).

\medskip
\begin{figure}[ht] 
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{grafik/cloud-computing} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Cloud computing: A metaphor for Internet services \cite{cloud:graphic}}
  \label{fig:cloud-computing}
\end{figure}

Cloud computing was introduced in 2006 by Google's CEO in a Talk about search engine strategies \cite{cloud:transcript}. The term is hard to define unambiguously. \citelit[P. 626]{cloud:overview} defines it as \enquote{one of the vaguest terminologies in the history of technology}. One reason is that cloud computing has many purposes. Moreover, the term is a marketing term used and abused by many companies. In 2009 it was one of the buzz-words in the IT industry that most often led to overblown expectations:

\begin{quote}
The levels of hype around cloud computing in the IT industry are deafening, with every vendor expounding its cloud strategy and variations [...], compounding the hype. \cite{cloud:hypecycle}
\end{quote}

According to the report quoted it will take less than five years for cloud computing to become \enquote{mainstream} (see the figure in section \ref{subsec:hype-cycle}).

Even though there exists no single definition of the term cloud computing, it is possible to establish unanimity over its basic concepts and general goals. Several definitions will be presented in the following section. After that the common styles of cloud computing will be presented. The chapter will be concluded with a section of the pros and cons of cloud computing.


\subsection{Definition}

First, two definitions from specialist literature will be presented:

\begin{quote}
Cloud Computing makes IT infrastructure, platforms and applications of all kinds available for use as on-line services. \citelit[Chap. 1.1]{cloud:cloudcomputing}
\end{quote}
 
\begin{quote}
Cloud Computing is a kind of computing technique where IT services are provided by massive low-cost computing units connected by IP networks. \citelit[P. 627]{cloud:overview}
\end{quote}


\citelit{cloud:overview} mentions further central characteristics of cloud computing: virtualisation of the services offered, dynamic scheduling of resources and high scalability. If an application needs extra resources, they can instantly and effortlessly be made available. The infrastructure automatically adapts to the fluctuating or growing needs.

\citelit{cloud:cloudcomputing} also stresses the criterion that the billing for such cloud computing services is usually done based on usage. It only charges for needed amount of resources and only those are made available. Thanks to their flexible nature, using these services may significantly lower operation costs.

The definitions mentioned above do not determine if services are hosted by distributed systems or by single, high-performance servers. This contrasts with \textit{grid computing} which always involves distributed systems.


\subsection{Styles}

Cloud computing emerged around the turn of the century, when the Internet's expansion raised the bar for existing storage and computing facilities. Personal computers became ever cheaper; Internet service providers started to use them as the basic hardware platform \citelit{cloud:overview}. In order to put computer clusters flexibly into use, several software models were developed. That way computer resources could be abstracted, which gave rise to three major cloud computing styles. Their representation is based on \citelit{cloud:overview}.

Amazon's cloud computing concept is based on \textit{server virtualisation}. Since 2006 several web services are offered under the name of \textit{Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. These make virtualised computing resources available for general use. Since AWS was initially cheaper than previous providers for on demand provision of such services, AWS pioneered the \enquote{Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)} industry. This thesis will make use of \textit{Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)}, which is based on the virtualisation software \textit{Xen}, the \textit{Simple Storage Service (S3)} and the storage \textit{Elastic Block Store (EBS)}. All these services are part of AWS.

Known representatives of the other two cloud computing styles include Google and Microsoft. Google offers \textit{technique-specific sandboxes} that allow the hosting of applications that have been developed using certain technologies. Heroku, another company, offers similar services for applications written in the programming language Ruby. Microsoft's \textit{Azure} service offers a combination of server virtualisation and technique-specific sandboxes.

Server virtualisation is regarded as the solution that is most flexible and most compatible with existing software and applications. The other approaches impose stricter limits on the choice of programming language, since every service only supports certain technologies.	On the other hand, server-virtualisation means higher abstraction complexity. This approach is currently the most popular cloud computing technique to abstract services and resources.

The different styles mentioned above allow different ways of cloud computing. According to \cite{cloud:enzyklopaedie}, these are subdivided into three layers:

\begin{description}
\item[Software as a Service (SaaS)] - A SaaS provider provides software as a service on the Internet. The software can be used without having to know about or deal with the infrastructure that serves as a basis for the service.
\item[Platform as a Service (PaaS)] - A PaaS provider makes a platform available that allows easier access to a combination of different services.
\item[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)] - IaaS providers offer hardware as an infrastructural service on which individuals and companies may run their own services.
\end{description}

Figure \ref{fig:aas} lists target audiences and examples for providers for each of the three levels.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{grafik/cc-services} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{The three levels of cloud computing}
  \label{fig:aas}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Pros and cons}

Cloud computing is described in \citelit[p. 629]{cloud:overview} as a win-win strategy for the service provider and its users.

One of the advantages is that business requirements can be met on demand: customers can adjust at any moment the amount of resources available to tailor them to the actual needs. This saves money and energy. Resource management can be further enhanced by dynamic \textit{resource scheduling}.

The disadvantages include the fact that traditional hosting providers usually have clearer answers to the questions of privacy and security, since here only the user knows how the system is configured. Moreover, the reliability of the services is not guaranteed in case of technical failures or power outages. In cloud computing this may have devastating consequences since such an incident may not shut off just a single service, but interrupt all services at once. Such problems can be avoided with \textit{Service Level Agreements} that warrant the scope of services and their quality. Another noteworthy disadvantage of cloud computing is that it is usually impossible to migrate services to another provider. Until now, external interfaces have hardly been defined. Because of the advantage in competition most of those services are currently proprietary \citelit{cloud:cloudcomputing}.

In order to be able to estimate the financial gains from cloud computing, the costs of the actual use of cloud services in hours or server units have to be compared to the costs of owning a data centre or IT infrastructure. In doing so, the average load of the data centre has to be factored in. Also to be taken into consideration is the fact that a data centre's capacity is fixed, whereas cloud services have upwardly open limits \citelit[Chap. 7.2.1]{cloud:cloudcomputing}.
